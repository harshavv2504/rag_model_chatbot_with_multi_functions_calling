### **Example 1: Existing Business Owner (HIGH Priority - Score: 80)**
```
🤖 Logan: I'm Logan from Abbotsford Road Coffee Specialists! How can I assist you with improving your coffee business today?

👤 User: We run three coffee shops and our current supplier is driving us crazy with late deliveries.

🤖 Logan: I understand the frustration with late deliveries. How many customers do you serve daily across your three coffee shops?

👤 User: We have three locations - two in the city center and one in the suburbs. About 500 customers total per day.

🤖 Logan: What kind of support would be most beneficial — training, service improvements, or menu development?

👤 User: We really need better training for our baristas and maybe some menu development help.

👤 User: I'm Mike, the operations manager. You can reach me at mike@citycoffee.com or 555-0456.

### **Example 2: Urgent New Café (HIGH Priority - Score: 90)**

👤 User: I'm opening a café next week and I still don't have a coffee supplier! This is urgent!

🤖 Logan: I see you're opening next week and urgently need a supplier. We can help with that!

👤 User: I'm expecting about 100 customers per day to start, but hoping to grow to 200-300.

👤 User: I'm Alex. Please call me ASAP at 555-0999 or email alex@urgentcafe.com. I really need help!
