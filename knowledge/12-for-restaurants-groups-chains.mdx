# For Restaurants, Groups & Chains

## Pricing and Volume

### Pricing Model
Simple and transparent. Pricing is based on the coffee, volume, and service package you choose. No complicated math — just a clear path to profitability.

### Volume Discounts and Contract Pricing
Yes. If you're scaling or committing to a program across multiple locations, we offer structured pricing that rewards volume — and locks in support.

### Minimum Order and Average Volume
We typically recommend starting around 30 pounds a month, but we can scale much higher for multi-site partners. We tailor it based on your actual needs — not some arbitrary number.

### Per-Pound Pricing
It depends — on your coffee choice, service package, and volume. We don't do one-size-fits-all. Let's connect you with a Sales Consultant who can recommend the right program and give you a tailored quote.

## Equipment and Setup

### Equipment Selection
Absolutely. We'll assess your volume, service speed, and bar layout — and recommend the right machines, brewers, grinders, and accessories to match.

### Equipment Range
We offer a huge range — from entry-level machines for boutique cafés to heavy-duty commercial setups for multi-site venues. Espresso machines, grinders, brewers — whatever your program needs, we'll match the right equipment to your goals.

### Servicing and Maintenance
Yes. We coordinate maintenance support plans and can connect you with rapid-response techs to minimize downtime. Regular check-ins keep your equipment humming.

## Multi-Location Programs

### Program Design Across Multiple Locations
Yes. We've done it for dozens of partners. We help standardize recipes, training systems, and reporting to ensure every location delivers the same great coffee experience.

### Consistency Across Batches
We roast on precision equipment, calibrate daily, and cup every production batch. We also monitor brew recipes with partners to keep customer experience tight.

### Contract Roasting Services
Yes. Full-service contract roasting — from sourcing and profiling to roasting and packaging. Your brand, your flavor, your name on the bag.

## Coffee Program Development

### Opening a Coffee Program
Absolutely. We'll help you design the coffee bar, select the right equipment, build a menu, train the team, and market it to your customers. End-to-end support.

### What Makes Us Different
We solve problems — not just roast coffee. From menu building to operational efficiency, we're commercial thinkers who know how to make coffee a real profit center.

### POS and Tech Integration
Yes. We're experienced in integrating coffee programs into POS, inventory management, and ordering platforms — making your back-end as smooth as your front-end service.

## Getting Started

### Speed to Launch
Fast. Samples in days. Equipment and training lined up right after. Our goal is momentum — no long delays or endless forms.

### Consultation Process
Of course. We can set up a call, Zoom, or in-person meeting — whatever suits you best to keep things moving forward.

### Onboarding Process
Fast, structured, and hands-on:
- Consultation & On-Site Assessment
- Proposal Submission
- Account Setup & Equipment Ordering
- Site Inspection & Install Checklist
- Equipment Install (10 days typical timeline)
- Staff Training
- Go Live Support

We make the process simple and momentum-driven so you can launch with confidence.

## Company Information

### Roastery Location
Our roastery is based in Red Hook, Brooklyn — right in the heart of NYC. It's where we roast fresh daily, host tastings and trainings, and welcome partners to see the full Abbotsford Road experience.

### Australian Coffee Culture
It's a culture built on quality, skill, and pride. Australian cafés focus on espresso excellence, well-trained baristas, sharp menus, and a deep respect for coffee as a full experience — not just a caffeine fix. We bring that same standard to every partner we work with.

### Events and Hosting
Yes, absolutely. We host tastings, training sessions, team offsites, brand launches, and coffee education events at our Red Hook roastery. If you've got an idea, we'll help bring it to life.

### Career Opportunities
We're always on the lookout for passionate people who care about coffee, service, and growth. If you want to be part of Abbotsford Road, reach out. Even if we're not actively hiring, we love connecting with great people.
