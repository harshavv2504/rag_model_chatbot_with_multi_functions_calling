# How Do You Design Your Team?

## Our Approach to Building a High-Performing Team

We believe great businesses are built on great people — not just talent, but the right people in the right roles. When we started Abbotsford Road, our vision went beyond roasting exceptional coffee. We wanted to create a team that could help cafés and restaurants grow, stand out, and succeed. Our approach is people-first, focusing on:

- **Hiring experts in their craft** who are also deeply invested in making a difference
- **Placing team members in roles** where they thrive and drive real impact
- **Aligning every role** to our mission of helping our customers succeed

This mindset ensures every partnership we create is backed by a team that truly understands coffee and hospitality.

## Key Team Members and Their Roles

Our team is built with specialists across operations, branding, training, and growth, each playing a crucial role in supporting our café and hospitality partners:

### Leadership Team
- **Pedro – CEO**: Oversees operations and scaling, ensuring the roastery runs efficiently and consistently delivers high-quality coffee to partners
- **Logan – Founder & Director of Business Development**: Helps café and hospitality partners refine their coffee programs, find their edge, and grow sustainably
- **Karl – Director & Producer of Strategic Growth**: Leads the company's expansion, ensures smart growth, and keeps Abbotsford Road ahead of industry trends

### Operations and Training
- **Jerico – Barista Training Lead**: Trains café teams to consistently serve exceptional coffee and maintain high standards across every shift
- **Eddie & the Production Crew**: The backbone of operations, responsible for roasting, packing, and delivering every bag of coffee with precision and care

### Branding and Sales
- **JC – Branding Expert**: Helps cafés and restaurants stand out in competitive markets with strategic brand development and coffee program alignment
- **Martin & Tim – Sales Partners**: Work closely with customers to provide growth-focused solutions rather than just selling products, acting as true partners in success

### Support Functions
- **Finance Team**: Manages finances to ensure smooth operations, smart investments, and ongoing support for the company's growth and its customers

## How Our Team Structure Benefits Partners

By designing a team around customer success, every role is tied to helping partners achieve their goals. This translates to:

- **Hands-on operational support**, like workflow and training for café teams
- **Tailored growth strategies**, from menu design to private-label branding
- **Reliable production and delivery**, keeping partners stocked with quality coffee on time
- **Consultative sales**, where solutions are designed to drive revenue, not just move products

Our team is an extension of our partners' businesses, ensuring they get the resources and insights to thrive.

## What Drives Our Strong Culture

Our culture didn't happen by accident — we built it deliberately around passion, customer focus, and collaboration. Key principles include:

- **Hiring for passion and expertise**, allowing people to excel in their roles
- **Customer success first**, because we only win when our customers win
- **Encouraging growth and innovation**, creating a space where the team can evolve with the industry

This culture keeps our team motivated, ensures high standards, and translates directly to better outcomes for our partners.
