# Ordering and Storing: How to Keep Your Coffee Fresh

## Importance of Proper Coffee Storage

Proper storage is critical because once coffee is roasted, it immediately starts to lose freshness. Coffee is highly sensitive to light and air, which can cause it to absorb moisture and odors from its surroundings and break down the natural oils that give it flavor. Storing coffee in an airtight container or sealed package, away from direct sunlight, protects its taste and extends shelf life.

## Temperature and Storage Form Effects

Temperature stability is key to maintaining flavor:

- **Cooler storage** helps coffee develop a smoother, softer taste
- **Warmer storage** can create a bolder, more intense flavor but shortens shelf life
- **Avoid temperature fluctuations** of over 50°C (122°F) in a single day, as they rapidly reduce freshness

Additionally, whole bean coffee lasts longer than ground coffee because grinding exposes more surface area to air, light, and moisture, speeding up flavor loss.

## Ideal Timing for Peak Flavor

Freshly roasted coffee needs 5–7 days to develop its peak flavor. After that:

- **Espresso** is best enjoyed within 1 month of roasting
- **Drip and cold brew methods** allow a bit more flexibility, staying optimal for 4–6 months

By storing properly and timing your use, you ensure every cup delivers its intended flavor and aroma.
