# CASE STUDY: Packaging Matters — Why We Said Goodbye to FracPacks

## What are FracPacks and the Problem They Created

FracPacks are pre-measured packets of ground coffee used in drip brewers to provide consistent coffee strength with a simple rip, pour, and brew process. The Texas diner chain used them because "that's just the way we've always done it."

However, FracPacks created a major cost problem: the diner was overpaying by nearly 20% for the convenience of packaging, which equals 20 cents per dollar or 20% per pound of coffee. This meant they were spending extra money on packaging rather than actual coffee.

## Abbotsford Road's Solution and Results

Abbotsford Road replaced the FracPacks used by the Texas diner chain with four simple scoops attached to their coffee machines, allowing employees to measure and brew coffee manually. This simple operational change delivered several benefits:

- **Immediate 20% savings** on coffee costs
- **Elimination of messy FracPack waste**
- **Maintained consistent coffee quality** without unnecessary packaging expenses

## Key Takeaway

Replacing FracPacks with scooped ground coffee saved money, reduced waste, and proved that small operational adjustments can create significant profitability improvements.
